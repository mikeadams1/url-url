        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

        <p>
          The URL Working Group will take over responsibility for the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/url/">URL Technical Report</a>
          from the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/Overview.html">Web
            Applications Working Group</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The scope of the URL Working Group covers the
          <em>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domains, IP addresses, the
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded format, and associated
          application programming interfaces (APIs)</em>. </p>

        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>The URL Working Group’s work will be considered a success if there
          are multiple independent complete and interoperable implementations of
          its deliverables that are widely used.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Test suites for each deliverable with conformance criteria.</li>
          <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable browser
            implementations of each deliverable with normative conformance
            requirements for browser implementations, as demonstrated by an
            implementation report (summarizing implementation status against the
            relevant test suite).</li>
          <li>If participants from fewer than three distinct browser-engine
            projects are participating in the group, its charter should be
            re-examined by the W3C.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="deliverables">
        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

        <p>The working group will deliver at least the following:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt id="url">
            <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/url/raw-file/default/Overview.html">URL</a>
          </dt>

          <dd>This specification defines the syntax, process and error handling
            for resolving URL, a sequence of characters from the Universal
            Character Set, along with guidelines and security considerations for
            the use of URL on the Web. It also defines an API to work with the
            components of a URL. This specification will be published in its
            entirety under the terms of the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">W3C
            Software Notice and License</a>.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known
          security implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
          The WebApps WG will actively seek security, privacy,
          internationalisation and accessibility review on all its
          specifications.</p>

        <p>After a specification reaches Recommendation status the working group
          may begin work on, and deliver an updated version of the specification
          under this charter. Specifications may be moved to Recommendation and
          a subsequent version begun in order to facilitate the progress of
          other work which depends on a stable reference.</p>

        <h3 id="other-deliverables">Other Deliverables</h3>
        <p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>

        <div id="ig-other-deliverables">
          <ul>
            <li>Test suites for each specification</li>
            <li>Reference Implementations for each specification</li>
            <li>Primers for each specification</li>
            <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency,
            and implementability, and to promote interoperability between User
            Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed by the end of the Candidate
            Recommendation phase, and must be completed, with an
            implementation report, before transition to Proposed
            Recommendation.  Additional tests may be added to the test suite
            at any stage of the Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a
            implementation report is encouraged.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>

        <p>
          The group's
          <a>Specification Status</a>
          document provides current data about all of the group's
          specifications, including Technical Report publication plans and
          testing status. Although group expects to progress all of its
          specifications during this charter period, the charter does not
          include detailed
          <em>milestone</em>
          data for each specification because such data is speculative and
          easily becomes out of date. Nevertheless, a Candidate Recommendation
          of the URL Specification is expected in 2015.

      </div>

      <div class="dependencies">
        <h2 id="coordination">Dependencies and Liaisons</h2>
        <h3>Dependencies</h3>

        <p>The URL specification depends on the 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/">DOM</a>, 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/">Encoding</a>,

          <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML</a>
          Working Group depend upon the URL Specification.</p>

        <h3 id="liaisons">Liaisons</h3>
        <p>The URL Working Group expects to maintain contacts with at least
          the following groups and Activities within W3C (in alphabetical
          order):</p>

        <p>To be successful, the URL Working Group is expected to have 5 or
          more active participants for its duration, and to have the
          participation of industry leaders in fields relevant to the
          specifications it produces.</p>
        <p>For each specification the Working Group will name at least one Test
          Facilitator whose responsibility is to ensure that a Test Suite is
          made available.</p>
        <p>The Chairs, specification Editors and test Facilitators are expected
          to contribute one to two days per week towards the Working Group.
          There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>
        <p>The URL Working Group welcomes participation, with agreement from
          each participant to the provisions of the W3C Patent Policy.
          Note: by the time this charter is approved, the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/01-invited-expert.html">2015/01</a>

            mode</a>
          of the group is described in detail. In general the group
          does not hold teleconferences, and may meets face to face at the
          TP/AC.  It may hold more meetings.  Note the
          <a href="#decisions">Decision Policy</a>
          below with regards to synchronous meetings.
        </p>

        <p>Most of the technical work of the group will be using the
          following venues:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <a href="mailto:whatwg@whatwg.org" 
              id="whatwg.org">whatwg@whatwg.org</a>
            (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/">archive</a>)
            mailing list is used for general discussions of specifications
            developed by the WHATWG.
          </li>

          <li>
            An <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/url/issues">issues</a>
            list is maintained at
            <a href="http://www.webplatform.org/">WebPlatform.org</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            A <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/c/url">discourse</a>
            category is made available on an experimental basis.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Editors within the group will use
          <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> to maintain Editor's Draft of
          specifications. The group's <i>action</i> and <i>issue</i>
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/track/">tracking data</a> will
          also be public, as will the participant-approved <i>minutes</i> from
          all teleconferences.</p>

        <p>There is also a Team-confidential mailing list for coordination
          between the Team and Chairs. </p>

        <p>
          Up-to-date information about the group (for example, details about
          deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants) is available
          from the
          <a>URL Working Group home page.</a>

      <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

        <p>As explained in the W3C Process Document
          (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
          3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an
          editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then
          refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>

        <p>The only Calls for Consensus expected by the URL working group
          will be for process related items: e.g., decisions related to exit
          criteria and transition requests.</p>

        <p>Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is
          to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the
          publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working
          groups mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list
          within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>
